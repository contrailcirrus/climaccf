Installation
============

The installation is the first step to working with EnVLiB. In the following, the steps required to install the library are provided (Some parts need to be modified, 
for instance, I need to check the current EnVLiB is compatible with which versions of pythons, and also, for release, we may decide to publish it under
PyPi, so downloading or cloning the library is not the only option). 

0. it is highly recomended to create a virtual environment:

::

    conda create -n env_EnVLib
    conda activate env_EnVLib
    
1. Clone or download the repository.

2. Locate yourself in the envlib (library folder) path, and run the following line, using terminal (in MacOS and Linux) or cmd (Windows), which will install all dependencies:

::

    python setup.py install

3. The installation package contains a set of sample data and an example script for testing purpose. To run it, at the library folder, enter the following command:

::

    python setup.py pytest

4. The library runs successfully if env_processed.nc is generated at the library folder/test/sample_data/. One can visualize the file using a visualization tool.

Configuration
=============

The scope of EnVLiB is to provide individual and merged aCCFs as spatially and temporally resolved information considering meteorology from the actual synoptical situation, the aircraft type, the selected physical climate metric, and the selected version of prototype algorithms in individual aCCFs. Consequently, some user-preferred settings need to 
be defined. Within EnVLiB, theses settings are defined in a dictionary, called *confg* (i.e., confg ['name'] = value). Notice that default
Default values for the settings have been defined within the library database; thus, defining dictionary *confg* is optional and, if included, overwrites the default ones.

Input
=====

To calculate aCCFs, some meteorological variables are required. EnVLiB takes these variables as input (See Table 5 of the connected paper (i.e., DietmÃ¼ller et al. (2021)). 
These variables are Temperature, Geopotential height, Relative humidity over ice, and Potential vorticity at different pressure levels, 
and outgoing longwave radiation (or top net thermal radiation) and incoming solar radiation at the top of the atmosphere. 
The current implementation of the Library is compatible with the standard of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) data (for both reanalysis and forecast data products).
The user should provide two datasets, separating data provided at each pressure level and surface variables, typically collected in different datasets. Within EnVLiB, the directories of these two datasets are to be defined as follows:

::

    input_dir = {}
    input_dir['path_pl']  = dir_pressure_variables  # Directory for input data provided in pressure levels such as temperature, geopotential and relative humidity
    input_dir['path_sur'] =  dir_surface_variables  # Directory for input data provided in single pressure level such as top net thermal radiation at the the TOA

In addition to the locations of input data, the directory of the EnvLiB needs to be specified within input_dir:

::

    input_dir ['path_lib'] = EnVLiB_dir      # Directory of EnVLiB

Finally, the directory where all outputs will be written is to be inputted by the user:

::

    output_dir = dir_results    # Destination directory where all output will be written

Running & Output
================

After defining configurations and inputting required directories, EnVLiB is ready to generate outputs. First of all, we import the library: 

::

    import envlib
    from envlib.main_processing import ClimateImpact

Then, the inputted variables will be processed by using the following function. The processing in this step is mainly related to 1) extracting variables within inputted data, 2) calculating required variables from alternative ones in case of missing some variables (see Table 5 of the connected paper), 3) unifying the naming and dimension of variables, and 4)changing the resolution and geographical area. 
The preferred horizontal resolution and geographical area are inputted to the function. Notice that the horizontal resolution cannot be higher than the resolution of the inputted meteorological data.

::

    CI = ClimateImpact(input_dir, horizontal_resolution=resolution, lat_bound=(lat_min, lat_max), lon_bound=(lon_min, lon_max), save_path=output_dir)


After processing the weather data, aCCFs are calculated using the following command with respect to the defined settings in the dictionary (i.e., confg) and saved within the netCDF file format in the specified directory. 
::

    CI.calculate_accfs(**confg)

Following the previous steps, an output file (in netCDF format) will be generated. The output file contains different variables depending on the selected configurations (in *confg*). 
For instance, the output file contains both individual and merged aCCFs  if confg ['merged'] = True and the inputted metrological parameters if confg ['MET_variables'] = True. The dimension of outputted variables for the Ensemble prediction system (EPS) data products is (time, member, pressure level, latitude, longitude), and for the deterministic ones is (time, pressure level, latitude, longitude).
The generated netCDF file is compatible with well-known visualization tools such as ferret, NCO, and Panoply.
In addition to the netCDF file, if one selects: confg['geojson'] = True, confg[Chotspots] = True, some GeoJson files (number: pressure levels * number of time) will be generated in the specified output directory.
